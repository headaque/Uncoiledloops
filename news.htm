War is a terrible thing. It has touched and taken so many lives down through the ages...and continues to do so. This album was inspired by those who suffered and/or died during WWII, so the world we live in today could be a better place. <BR>

In this fast world in which we live today, it's easy to forget to take a second to remember those who gave their lives so selflessly all those years ago. They were real people, just like us, who loved, hoped and dreamed...regardless of which side they were on or where in the world they lived. <BR>


As you listen to the tracks on this release, please do just that...and don't forget those men, women, and children...they deserve not to be forgotten.<BR><BR>

<a href="http://qniezery.bandcamp.com/album/spell-my-name-in-slowmo">spell my name in slowmo by QNIEZERY</a></iframe>

<br><BR>
From the concrete-clad west side of Rotterdam comes QNIEZERY. And from him comes 'spell my name in slowmo'. Don't bother asking questions about the name or the album title. Listen. <BR>

'spell my name in slowmo' is a mix of uncomforting beats with soothing, inspirational melodies. Early dubstep and late 90's electronics collide in what is simply defined as Bass Music. <BR>
But behind that bass there's a multitude of sounds to discover, many of which originated as field recordings from late night and early morning city walks. There's guitars, viola da gamba's, bells, and all sorts of physical instruments integrated with otherwise sterile computer based - but amply shuffled - beats.<BR><BR>

CAUTION! Do Not Listen while Driving. Its that Hypnotic. You'll arrive and not remember how you got here. <BR>

Like smooth lava flow, Oelki's tracks are glowing and warm, the constant thump is like a heart beat of the earth. In the club, this will tickle your ears and the bass kick your chest while you move in the darkness until light. <BR>

Hailing from Germany, Oelki has been producing Techno/Microhouse for only 3 years and has created these 6 most remarkable tracks for this collection. You need to hear this to believe it.<BR>

You may recognize 2 artists from previous Uncoiled Loops compilations and releases, Ambient Mechanics and Secant Prime, of which the former (AM), with the help of IDMforums.com, was instrumental in organizing this compilation.
On this album, you find some artists such as Kneedless, are "found sounds" artists using things like ping-pong balls in mixing bowls, some are neo-classical artists such as Daniel & Mikael Tjernberg, and some, such as Forbidden Star, came from punk roots or various other genres, now trying the other end of musical expression.

<Br><BR>According to Wikipedia, Dubstep came forth from UK Garage in the early 2000s, containing overwhelming bass lines and funky drum patterns.  Darkhop, on the other hand, is a much lesser referenced style, and is only mentioned in the Scorn entry.  In many minds, these are one and the same genre.  As an attempt to bring artists subscribing to these two similar genres together, Uncoiled Loops has compiled an 11 track compilation, bringing artists influenced by Kode9, Scorn, Burial, Godflesh, and Boxcutter to one CD.  To hear what these artists brought forth, a FREE DJ mix of all 11 artists is available for free from the CD baby site.  The CD contains the 11 individual tracks as well as bonus Multimedia material, including this 48 minute DJ mix.<BR><BR><a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/AlbumDetails.aspx?AlbumID=VariousArtists327">Get it here!</a><BR><BR><BR>

This is a 43 minute recording (indexed by the minute) walks from trimming the final car, through the body shop welding, back through chassis, out through final testing.  It calms babies while giving us adults a little more to listen to than the standard white noise CDs and/or a sample CDr for musicians.
