      already appeared on a few samplers in their homeland (USA), but I think 
      they're less familiar to most of you. Their style has been built up with a 
      strong wave basis, but the more I walked through their demo, the more I 
      perceive pure electronic structures which even move on the border of 
      modern electronic. There's also a vague, but irresistible mystical element 
      by the way of singing. The female vocal parts are like emerging from the 
      depths, like a magical elixir... Notice by the way that next to some 
      remixes, this demo also contains work from other bands that has been 
      remixed by CEOXiME. The first pieces aren't fully worthwhile <I>[ed. 
      note-remixes for CEOXiME by other bands, some removed from official 
      release of Vibrant Grey]</I>, but the second part (simply entitled bonus 
      tracks) sounds pretty cool! You can here listen to the remixes the band 
      realised for other formations like Diverje, Noxious Emotion, Function 13 
      and a few other ones. </FONT></FONT></TD></TR>

      David</B></FONT></FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=arial><FONT size=-1>CEOXiME is a 
      duo now emerging from the Detroit electro scene, and while I suppose 
      comparisons to Collide, Waiting for God, et. al. are inevitable at this 
      point (since CEOXiME uses a similar formula of electro/industrial with 
      ethereal female vocals), in all honesty, I think CEOXiME have the 
      potential to possibly even surpass the aforementioned. hEADaCHE¹s 
      electronics are cleaner and more creative (with the added bonus of being 
      guitarless...), and Tatiana¹s vocals have a more innocent, airy quality to 
      them (without sounding quite as contrived) as the above-mentioned¹s 
      sometimes do. While technically an E.P., Vibrant Grey plays more like a 
      full-length (even despite the abundant remixes, which, for a change, are 
      quite different from the originals in most cases), and is rarely 
      repetitive. To be truthful, I can¹t seem to keep this disc out of my 
      player-it¹s that good! A very impressive debut, definitely recommended to 
      fans of the sub-genre... </FONT></FONT></TD>

      two-piece electronic outfit from Detroit that features Tatiana on vocals 
      and hEADaCHE doing all the programming. Tatiana has a divine voice, surely 
      bestowed upon her by angels. The programming and keys draw a fine line 
      between your typical skitter-scatter reverberations and a tunnel of 
      trippy, time-warp sounds. The cascading beats swirl like smoke and create 
      a spacious climate for Tatiana's wails and echoes...There's 13 of tracks 
      on this album, which can be purchased through the Web site. Don't be 
      afraid to give this album a shot, you won't be disappointed.</FONT></FONT>

      <H2><A href="http://www.bioplaza.com/specimen/">Specimen</A> - J 
      Danos</FONT></H2><FONT face=arial><FONT size=-1>With its unique 
      combination of militant beats and Tatiana's soft ambient vocals, it's easy 
      to see why Invisible Records is eyeing the latest release from Ceoxime. 
      Vibrant Grey captures the genuine atmospheres from your favorite 4AD 
      releases and gives them an electronic twist. Mixing up the compositional 
      styles with each track, Headache keeps the album interesting and provides 
      a sensible sonic soundscape with occasional Dive-esque rhythms, sometimes 
      leaning towards modern trance. Vibrant Grey is tentatively scheduled for a 
      February 2002 release. <BR><BR>"Subsume" starts the disc off wih dark 
      atmospheres and wailing female vocals in the vein of Android Lust. The 
      aural image is complimented by droning subs, a house beat complete with 
      claps, and resonant fluttering synths. The synths are subdued and light, 
      always bowing to the sublime dominance of Tatiana's voice. <BR><BR>The 
      "Needles Mix" of "Sister Sin" is next, with its pulsing synth bass and 
      echoing vox. Bubbly hi-end synths seem to float and fade into the mix. A 
      forceful hi-hat restlessly pushes the rythm.<BR><BR>The "Crazy Mix" of 
      Innocence changes the pace with "crazy" samples and frenetic resonant 
      synths. Swelling ambience, piano accents and drums engulfed in reverb 
      create a nice 4AD feeling.<BR><BR>Dreamy atmospheric vocals compliment a 
      trancey synth lead (think Time Modem) on the next track, titled "Hidden 
      Affliction." An ominous sustained bass plays leapfrog with subtle paino 
      accents. Minimal overdriven kicks are impregnated with jungle hihats. 
      Watch your heart rate on this one. <BR>Be afraid...be very afraid. The 
      "Dissolve Mix" of "Afraid" will surprise you with its rogue bass and hard 
      distorted kick. Delicate atmospheric synths present a Bites era Skinny 
      Puppy charm. <BR><BR>Alien pads, slow building drumloops and spacey ice 
      crystal melodies create an other-world experience which successfully 
      distracts you from the "Horror Inside."<BR><BR>Borrowing some gritty 
      rythms from the digital school of Gridlock, "Vibrant Grey" combines 
      throbbing subs, drum n' bass elements, and sporadic malignant bass sounds. 
      Tatiana's vocals are complimented by distorted male whispering courtesy of 
      Function13. <BR><BR>Adding a middle-eastern flavor to this already 
      schizophrenic disc, "Innocence (Avatar Mix)" takes a soundtrack pad loop 
      and swelling synths and infuses them with some unique sampled vocals from 
      Tatiana. Subtle gated effects dance with the fast beat as funky samples 
      breath some bounce into the cerebral mood of this song. <BR><BR>I had 
      heard the "Esion Mix" of "Scream" once before on a comp, and I am still 
      convinced that this is a fascinating mix. Gutteral vocal effects, bizarre 
      samples, subtle guitar sounding loops and a Shamen groove create a track 
      not unlike something from FLA's Intermix sideproject. <BR><BR>The 
      "Heartless Mix" of "Sister Sin" seems to slow the pace of the original, 
      without losing the pulse. A minimal delayed bass and creeping rhythm 
      create a backdrop for hidden vocals and tweaking hi-end pulses. The track 
      progresses with a slow build like a traditional trance song, sans the 
      repetitive beats. <BR><BR>A restless synth sequence and obnoxious beat 
      follow in the "Demon Trance Mix" of "Subsume." Swarming Lords of 
      Acid-styled leads and VNV Nation's version of Trance beats create an 
      excursion that doesn't do the original version justice. <BR><BR>The Drum 
      N' Bass influenced "More Afraid" packs more punch, with its dualing vocal 
      effects and vocoders trampling over fragile pianos and trembling strings. 
      A slick mixture with give-and-take attitude renders an enjoyable balance 
      of obsession and fear before the song breaks down to a minimal beat. 
      <BR><BR>Ending this disc is a remix edit by Ceoxime of a Crashsite68 
      track. "Exostatic" sounds like a traditional trance song, with a swollen, 
      muted intro. Piano accents and female vox create a feeling similar to some 
      of the dance remixes of Delerium's latest work, albeit Tatiana's voice is 
      much more subtle and not quite as confident and in-your-face. <BR><BR>Fans 
      of The Azoic, Android Lust, and Fockewolf would really enjoy this disc, as 
      well as anyone looking for a refreshing mixture of hard but soft, cold but 
      warm, alien but somehow human electronic music.</FONT></FONT>

      size=-1>This eclectic piece of electronica like many things and nothing I 
      have ever heard of before. There are only vague characteristics we can use 
      to term or codify CEOXiME psychotic performance. I hear grand world music 
      and gothic influences next to deep industrial leanings and a love for 
      Europop. There is also a project mentality expressed on the CD. The 
      listener can tell that CEOXiME is a variable concept, rooted in a simple 
      one, but ever expanded upon in collaboration or remix. Sonically it's more 
      urban-goth and vocally I hear more respect being paid to Excessive Force 
      and Susan Vega...Many songs are beautifully crafted and dwelled upon, 
      still others are more raw and spontaneous. The live version of the album's 
      title track, "Vibrant Grey" is an excellent work compete with growling 
      zombie voices. I hope the final release includes the live, as well as a 
      studio mix. Perhaps the band can do a remix EP of the title track and call 
      the remix CD "GRAY V2". I am jumping ahead of myself. Speaking of remixes, 
      one of the best songs on Vibrant Grey is "Scream" as remixed by Esion, 
      fellow Detroit Electronica Coalition member, of which CEOXiME is heavily 
      involved in. I must also say, that the vocal track of "More Afraid" has 
      got to be the first time I have ever heard an auto-tune effect sound 
      musical. I thoroughly enjoyed this music, and I am a convert and a fan 
      now. The band has been teasing fans with pre-releases for a while. I hear 
      an amazing potential from the standpoint of production. Imagine all the 
      input that has gone into it so far! How long will we have to 
      wait!!??</FONT></FONT> <BR>

      are a taste of the new sound coming out of Detroit, MI these days. A dose 
      of heavy electro from hEADaCHE brewed with the witchery, Darkwave flavored 
      vocal stylings of Tatiana. A very nice combination of styles for 
      electronic music fans who also love the styles of bands like Bell, Book 
      &amp; Candle, Deep Red and the EBM music styles. The beats are heavy but 
      not too overpowering. hEADaCHE also ads a bit of nice dark cords in the 
      background, a touch of harpsichord-type sounds and quite a bit of effects 
      to flavor it all with at the start of the album then builds the entire 
      thing into a more Electronic Body "rockin" Music blend. There is obviously 
      a bit of techno influence here as well. Despite the name used by this 
      electronic musician his music will not give you a headache. It's 
      wonderful, dark, ambient, beat-heavy and overall lovely. I especially love 
      the way Tatiana's voice blends with hEADaCHE's dark ambient stylings on 
      tracks like "Innocence". What a great mix! The track builds up slowly and 
      draws you into it's trance-like pulse. However, the very next track 
      "Scream" is a bit more in the EBM vein as the album builds into some bonus 
      track remixes of other bands. This album is like a small self-contained 
      "dark-culture" nightclub. It's great!!</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=arial><FONT size=-1>This particular CD contains remixes of 
      tracks by Noxious Emotion, Diverje, esion and Paul Reset. It also has a 
      bonus 13th track strictly by CEOXiME titled "More Afraid" which is another 
      amazing electro-ambient-trance-darkwave track. Track 1 of this CD is also 
      featured on D[elEcTROnIc]T a various artist compilation by the Detroit 
      Electronica Coalition.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=arial><FONT size=-1>This is definitely a new sound for

      Keiser</A></FONT></H2><FONT face=arial><FONT size=-1>Let me just start out 
      by saying that there are a lot of electronic oriented bands in Michigan 
      that do not get the recognition they deserve. Ceoxime could be considered 
      one of these bands. Had they not put their information on the Michigan 
      Artists site, I may not have heard of them, nor have had the privilege to 
      hear the unique sounds they create. This CD is filled with whacked-out, 
      yet danceable rhythms, creative "how did they do that?" synth sounds, and 
      vibrant, illustrious vocals which at times, sound like an angel's voice 
      bellowing amongst the darkness surrounding some of the 
      melodies.</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=arial><FONT size=-1>One of my favorite tracks on the CD is 
      "Innocence" (crazy mix). In the vocals I hear sounds reminiscent of Dead 
      Can Dance and the Cocteau Twins; strong yet airy and ethereal. The rhythm 
      of this song is mind boggling. It moves along quickly, while establishing 
      a groove, only to leave it behind, then come back again. Another track 
      worthy of discussion is "Sister Sin" (V2). This song has a medieval/goth 
      industrial feel to it. The melodies are dark, with a mixture of dark and 
      light vocals. The song presents a combination of aggression and beauty all 
      wrapped up in layers of ear pleasing sound. There is also the 7th deadly 
      mix of this song, which pounds out a techno-like rhythm, almost along the 
      lines of Nitzer Ebb, with layers of rhythm tracks that seem to fall on, 
      then slightly off of each other to give a really great effect. Finally, 
      the song "Sky" (hEADaCHE mix) by Esion is another great one on this CD. It 
      has a smooth house/techno feel to it that provides a mesmerizing groove 
      and soothing vocals. This song gets my official "booty-shaking" seal of 
      approval.</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=arial><FONT size=-1>This CD will get your body moving, but 
      don't get me wrong, the songs on this CD are also very well thought out, 
      well structured and contain complex melodies and vocal patterns. I am 
      thoroughly impressed with hEADaCHE's manipulation of the "machines" that 
      were used on this CD, and am equally impressed with the vocal abilities of 
      Tatiana. This CD strongly confirms that good electronic music is well and 
      alive in the Detroit area!!! Check this band out, I assure you, you will 
      not be sorry.</FONT></FONT> <BR><BR>

      of decay, corrosion, rust and brittle cracking metal carcasses of days 
      gone by. Echoes of loss and despair blowing like subtle breezes through 
      the back of your formatted and unpartitioned mind - Detroit's CEOXiME 
      bring a computeresque yet breezy feel to their music. Survivors of 
      previous band Format C:, CEOXiME are the trance-inducing nightmares of 
      decay and desecration of hEADaCHE on machines and Tatiana on vocals. Their 
      music is a strange hybrid of industrial synths, jungled drums and 
      high-floating vocals that come together to create an eerie landscape that 
      has a Bladerunner sensation riveted throughout. It's not quite strong and 
      gut-wrenching - yet it's not quite ambient and melancholic. It's somewhere 
      in between. A stasis between joy and hell, love and despair.</FONT></FONT> 

      <P><FONT face=arial><FONT size=-1>CEOXiME are part of the Detroit 
      Electronica Coalition, a series of industrial and electronica artists from 
      the Michigan area. It wasn't until I discovered D[electronic]T (reviewed 
      in a previous issue) that I discovered how strong of a scene Detroit has. 
      The groups are seemingly woven together, like a patchwork steel quilt, 
      with one band sharing members with other bands and with this kind of thing 
      going on you know that the scene is going to be strongly supportive of 
      each other. This has bred a strength into the Detroit electronic music 
      scene that surpasses many others and is beginning to rival even the 
      European masters in countries across the pond in its power and 
      influence.</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=arial><FONT size=-1>Let's discuss their music now. CEOXiME 
      use a blend of a number of things, creating a trance-like nightmare. I'm 
      used to happy trance - trip hop. You know: My Scarlet Life, Brian Eno, AFX 
      - stuff that typically makes you feel good. CEOXiME is different in that 
      their flavor of trance is more touched with sorrow and is not suited for 
      the happy X-taking crowd. Instead it's trance goth style, with a morose 
      blend of chords and sounds that twist around a darker entity. One of the 
      closest sounds to come from a recent band, just to give you some semblance 
      of an idea, would be Collide.</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=arial><FONT size=-1>CEOXiME creates the type of music that 
      can be remixed and recreated at a very basic, underlying level without 
      losing the gist or direction of the original arrangement. Indeed much of 
      the work here on this demo CD are remixes of older work - and they invite 
      on another of my Detroit area favorites, esion. Track two holds the song 
      Horror Inside, which is in some ways brightly moving in the keyboard 
      arrangement with a toy piano melody kicking off the track. But with a 
      unique sense of contrast, hEADaCHE wraps the bright melody with windy 
      synthetic chord choruses that wrap around to create a near-nightmarish 
      ensemble. The rhythm is always changing - a consistent quality of 
      hEADaCHE's machinations that you'll see as the CD moves to other tracks. 
      Tatiana has a sultry flavor to her voice - a sexy, succubus feel to it. It 
      almost joins the arranged chords played on the keys to become a 
      multi-faceted chorale.</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=arial><FONT size=-1>Now an example of what I mean by the 
      "mixability" of CEOXiME's creations. After listening to track two, the 
      original Horror Inside, you can now jump to track seven, where esion 
      delivers his version - which remains the same in idea, but is extremely 
      different in make-up. esion has a more computeresque and industrial 
      approach, keeping much of the chord progression in the background but 
      adding in a more solid metallic-riff style to the front. Tatiana's voice 
      isn't as plentiful, esion only taking certain samples of her (such as 
      "Scream...!") and applying it. The toy piano becomes more of a data-blip 
      sound. But still - the contrasting intention of Horror Inside is shown 
      with the metal-against-wind quality of the chords.</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=arial><FONT size=-1>Innocence, which starts this demo CD I 
      have, is one of those trance-like songs that has many, many counterparts 
      and sounds to it stitched together and held in place by a strong beat 
      track. It is an example of their more floaty work, the depressive-trance 
      style I foreshadowed earlier in this column. A softer and more 
      rave-friendly remix of this track is found on track 5. While esion remixed 
      CEOXiME's song Horror Inside, hEADaCHE has taken esion's song Touch the 
      Sky and remixed this into a very fast-moving electronic/techno hybrid. It 
      is swapping mixes like this that shows how strong and supportive the 
      Detroit scene can be.</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=arial><FONT size=-1>CEOXiME - now I'm not quite sure what 
      the name is supposed to mean definitively, but I am quite sure I know what 
      it means musically. You can not have love without despair nor joy without 
      sadness. CEOXiME will bring you a set of dance/trance style music that has 
      a darker edge - and that makes it more real. Somebody has to bring these 
      X-ers down - not everything is lights and euphoria. Balance your dance 
      diet with a bit of moodiness - it'll make you more whole.</FONT></FONT>

      to compose a regular review knowing not what should I say in regards to 
      it's subject. Even though I get high on electronic music, it's always 
      somewhat difficult for me to describe what the hell is this or that effort 
      all about. The same case with CEOXiME, if you didn't notice it earlier. 
      "CEOXiME" features seven (as well as three bonus) tracks of mild, even 
      serene at times, yet atmospheric electronic music with celestial female 
      voice. No doubts, this combo (?) contrived to come up with a truly unique 
      form of ambience, however...However, I don't really know if I know what I 
      have to say here. Sorry for the pun, ladies and

A very hypnotic Industrial masterpiece with really cool female vocals, and multiple break-beat rhythms in the midst of chaos! Picture KMFDM if they were 100X better and lacked the "We think we’re so great" atitude!

 I absolutely love this compilation album, there's some excellent examples of industrial music on here that will blow your mind. There's music by: ENDIF, PTI, Y-LUK-O, CEOXIME, INFINITY INTERRUPTION, CRUCIFORM INJECTION, SEALED IN SILENCE, CRYOSTATE, 12 STITCHES, LUKOTYK, and COMPLIANT. This is by far one of my new favorite compilations (at least for this genre of music).<BR>Rating: 10+/10

      delectronict2<BR>CEOXiME's "Subsume" is a really nice ebm track. The 
      electronics are fairly simple but very effective. The strength of this 
      track is with the ethereal female vocals. The singer has a great voice 
      that compliments the music well and adds another dimension to trip hop's 
      ever evolving sound.</FONT></FONT> <FONT face=arial>

      loops and stuttered female vocal samples. Distorted synths kick in, 
      creating an almost guitarlike effect. A triphop groove ensues, creating a 
      textured and smooth progression. Picture Heavy Water Factory crossed with 
      Mentallo &amp; The Fixer and you might come close.</FONT></FONT>

      D[elEcTROnIc]T<BR>Innocence by CEOXiME A great song to go into following 
      Jason's soundscape style, you can still hear a bit of the Kraftwerk 
      influence permeating Innocence by CEOXiME. Along with many of the tracks 
      here, the STRESS! Factory is the studio in which these rhythmic movements 
      were laid down for our enjoyment. The computer format is still here in 
      full strength - on their website CEOXiME is defined as a "computer virus 
      damaging permanent devices and destroying memory. Music destroying all 
      knowledge of time and memory." The musical style isn't destructive 
      sounding - it's more of a low-key groove. Tatiana is the female vocalist, 
      providing an echoing and lovely spin that works very well with the 
      trance/jungle rhythm. Lastly, their website kicks MUCH ass. Definitely 
      check it out for the aesthetic value alone even if the electronica music 
      style doesn't appeal to you.</FONT></FONT> <FONT face=arial>

      are divaesque, spiritually uplifting and, obviously then, rather well 
      done. I haven't seen an official full length from CEOXiME yet, but check 
      out the review of their Demo . Subsume, while not my favorite on

CEOXiME (DEC): Now featuring myself (Alex from AprAxiA) on drums, our show went great, except for some crappy generator noise. Tanya belted out hits like "Sister Sin," "Subsume," and the CEOXiME cover/remix of Crash Site 68‘s "Exostatic," while Rob kept it real with the mixing and keyboards. Did you see all those creepy monsters dancing to "Vibrant Grey?"
