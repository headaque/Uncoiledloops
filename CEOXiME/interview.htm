<p><a NAME="MTI"></a><font face="arial"><font size=-2>(interview on Mirage
Tropics in early 1999)</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>AfekDead: What are your specific responsibilities?</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>hEADaCHE: I manage the machines and
Tatiana brings the human element to CEOXiME.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>AfekDead: Where are you from?</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>Tatiana: Im from the downriver area.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>hEADaCHE: Im originally from Kalamazoo,
and now I live in Belleville - the birthplace of techno!</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>AfekDead: In your own words, what type
of music do you play?</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>hEADaCHE: I guess I would have to say
EBM. We try to blend trance and jungle influences with electronic industrial
sounds with a touch of darkwave.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>AfekDead: Who are your influences?</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>Tatiana: Well thats a huge list, basically
everyone or anyone Ive listened to. Some of my major influences include
Bauhaus, Gitane Demone, Christian Death, and of course, Iggy. Artistically
I like Niagra of Dark Carnival.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>hEADaCHE: Same with me, the list can
go on and on. For industrial, I like alot of the old stuff - Skinny Puppy,
Pigface, Thrill Kill Kult, Godflesh. For techno, I like the old Art of
Noise albums, Hypnotic and Metalheadz labels, plus Im a big fan of Scorn.
I listen to alot of "shoegazer" noise pop ala Ride, Lush, Spacemen 3, and
Loop.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>AfekDead: Who are your influences besides
musically?</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>Tatiana: Basically every one arround
me - my friends and family.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>hEADaCHE: Me too, plus Nietzche, Terry
Gilliam, David Cronenburg...</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>AfekDead: What's your favorite album?</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>Tatiana: Hm...It would have to be Iggy
Pop - Party. The one with all the bubles...</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>hEADaCHE: I would have to say My Bloody
Valentine's Loveless...</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>AfekDead: What equipment are you using?</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>hEADaCHE: My arsenal is pretty limited.
My main keyboard is Ensoniq EPS16+ - a sampler which most of my sounds
come from. I also have a DX27 (Yamaha), a Peavey Profex, Roland M120 mixer,
Beringer Compressor and a Alesis 30 band EQ. I just recently picked up
a Alesis D-4, and I am looking to get a Digitech Quad4. I also have a bass,
guitar, and a bunch of pedals I dont use anymore...</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>AfekDead: Name your favorite piece
of equipment and why.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>hEADaCHE: Does it have to be one that
I own? I could name a bunch of keyboards I would love to have! Of the ones
I own, definitely the EPS16+. I would be lost without it.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>Tatiana: My voice box. ;)</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>AfekDead: Do you have an album in production?</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>hEADaCHE: Right now I am organizing
the Detroit Electronica Coalition CD. I will include many of the Mirage
Tropics bands - maybe we should change the name? ;)</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>AfekDead: Who is producing the release?</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>hEADaCHE: What is producing anyhow?
As far as who is funding it, all the bands involved are funding their portion
of the release, and they will be selling a portion of the final CDs. It
is to be mastered at Stress Factory Studios.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>AfekDead: What record label is releasing
the forthcoming work?</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>hEADaCHE: Well, Detroit Electronica
Coalition has no intention of becoming a label (right now at least).</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>AfekDead: What's it going to be released
as?</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>hEADaCHE: CD only.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>AfekDead: Can you explains the writing
situation?</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>hEADaCHE: I write chunks of songs,
then have Tatiana listen and pick out which ones would make good songs.
I then complete the song, then Tatiana puts the lyrics to them.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>AfekDead: Where do practice, write,
etc?</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>hEADaCHE: Right now I have my setup
in my living room. Since we arent doing any shows soon, we dont practice
together.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>AfekDead: What is the main focus when
writing lyrics to your music?</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>Tatiana: Probably mostly personal experiences.
I write lyrics in a very strange way, I usually sing whatever comes to
my head - right in the studio - and amazingly the first take is usually
the best one!</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>AfekDead: Do you have any upcoming
shows?</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>hEADaCHE: No, Just working on the Compilation.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>AfekDead: Have any advice you would
like to give to other musicians?</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>hEADaCHE: Me? Give advice? Shouldnt
they be giving me advice? If you play an instrument and want to play out,
and dont think youre good enough - thats crap! Just get out there and do
it! You surely have to be better than me! Also, dont focus too much on
equipment. Crappy equipment can get you along way. Just look at some of
the gold record selling techno artists (May, Craig, etc), they started
with a $100 keyboard and $50 drum machine. I know alot of musicians who
buy piece after piece without fully investigating what each one does. If
learn your equipment you could get better sounds from a $100 keyboard than
someone who has $5000 worth of equipment.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>Tatiana: Dont worry too much about
the money aspect to music. If you concentrate on the music it will all
come together.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>hEADaCHE: Oh yeah, and dont eat yellow
snow.</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>AfekDead: Have anything you would like
to say to your fans?</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>Tatiana: Thanks for listening!</font></font>
<p><font face="arial"><font size=-2>hEADaCHE: Dont eat yellow snow either.</font></font>
