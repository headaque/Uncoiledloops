CEOXiME's Theta now released on CD:<BR>
Theta is the final installment of original works of CEOXiME, an 8 year running project of Tatiana and hEADaCHE.  Their works have appeared on over 15 compilations, reviewed in over 20 magazines; and played with such notable bands such as Pigface, Gravity Kills, gODHEAD and Mindless Faith. So if you have had your ear to the ground, you would have heard of CEOXiME. Theta was picked up by one of the longest running industrial labels, Invisible, and released as MP3.  Now you can have this and Vibrant Grey all on 1 CD.
<BR><BR>

Excerpts from the upcoming Darksonus interview:
<BR>
So why release Theta now?  Hasn’t CEOXiME been dead for a couple of years?<BR>
Yes, CEOXiME ended at the end of 2005.   I never felt quite complete with the project though, and I had assembled a nice final CD and delivered it to Invisible.  I was always quite proud of this material and I wanted to see it all on CD.  Invisible opted to only do MP3 sales of the album, which omitted the extras that I had put with the CD – the artwork and the multimedia portion of the CD.  So I thought it would be good to finally put these things together for myself and all who supported CEOXiME. All in all, its over 2 hrs of really good music, mostly originals, but also some of the best remixes from Kritikal, King Rhythm, Interface, Function13 and Christ Analogue.  
<BR><BR>
What’s in the multimedia portion?<BR>
The full and complete Vibrant Grey encoded in 192 kbps, the complete color artwork of Vibrant Grey, and a few surprise extras as well.  
<BR><BR>
Track list:<BR>
1.  One:15 <BR>
2.  Stop in Your Tracks <BR>
3.  Beg'n'Plead <BR>
4.  Dirty and Used <BR>
5.  Seems to Be <BR>
6.  Tears <BR>
7.  Sister Sin (oxicodone mix) <BR>
8.  Stop in Your Tracks (Christ Analogue remix) <BR>
9.  Dirty'n'Used (King Rhythm remix) <BR>
10. Seems To Be (Kritikal remix)

6/07 news:<BR>Hey folks, havent updated you all in probably over a year - but something's are
a-brewin in the hEADaCHE homestead or crainium... Heres the "press release"...<BR>

Since the demise of CEOXiME in Nov '06, hEADaCHE has been working on
instrumental material (yet to be released under a different moniker) and
remixes of such artists as Rx, Biocarbon13, Saemskin, and Pigface - tentatively
planned for hEADaCHE remixes V3. The final release of CEOXiME "Theta" is still
in the works (CD version), but the pre-release is available digitally at most
of your favorite online retailers (itunes, emusic, etc.) from Underground Inc.
(Invisible Records). As well, the pre-release is available for hEADaCHE
remixes V2 "Highly Dangerous Defects" from the same record label and online
retailers. hEADaCHE also has been toying with the idea of a coversong album
with plans to pull in many guest vocalists from various bands.<BR>
<BR>

11/05 news:<br>
This news posting is a hard one to write.  First I would like to inform all of
you Tatiana has taken a lead vox role with a new band, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/chloroformandthegirl">Chloroform and the Girl</a>.  I figured this would be a good
time to end CEOXiME.  My music has changed direction as well as my outlets for
music.   Tatiana is more interested in live performances, where as I have been
happy with studio musicianship and remixing.  The distance did not help.  My
output has waned.  All and all, I figure it best to halt CEOXiME.
But I still plan to press up the final CEOXiME EP.  I plan to have this available
through download sites, such as Itunes, indefinitely.  I need to complete
mastering and choose suitable artwork for this endeavor.<br>
I plan to maintain the website, as well as releasing many of the "Seems to Be"
remixes (for free) on the site.  Uncoiled loops will remain; I
will maintain the CEOXiME myspace site as well.<BR>
I plan to continue to work on music instrumentally.  I am attempting a "fresh
start" and plan minimal to no online presence for this project.  I am doing
this to attempt to erase any preconceived notions about my work.  As well, I am
attempting to eliminate all wasted time on promotion and focus on music.  This
means I will be seeking a label for this project, probably in the vein of
Hymen, Antzen, or even Thrill Jockey or Hydrogen Dukebox...OK, OK, if you are
really interested, write me 3 paragraphs on how upset you are CEOXiME is over,
I'll give you some hints.<BR>
Now this doesn't mean Tatiana and I will never work together again.  We still
are on great terms, and I'm sure if she needs a remix or I need some guest
vocals, or if a CEOXiME reunion is in order, we may just crank it out!<BR><BR>

available through me at <a href="http://dec.gemm.com">http://dec.gemm.com</a>, or <a href="purchase.htm">paypal</a> for $12.49 - more info
