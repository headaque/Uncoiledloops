memory.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><BR><FONT face=arial><FONT size=-1>"Producers dream of 
finding a voice like hers when they place ads in the music classifieds. It's a 
lucky thing, for us and for CEOXiME, that hEADaCHE and Tatiana were brought 
together through one of these ads. In the early years they were known as Format 
C:, a project that fragmented in 1997. After their early work together, the 
creation of CEOXiME was inevitable. The connection between hEADaCHE and Tatiana 
was intense and magnetic, and they began new studio work within months of the 
breakup of Format C:. <I>My innocence is fading away,</I> sings Tatiana on the 
first released CEOXiME track on <A 
href="http://dec.gemm.com/">D[elEcTROnIc]T</A>. This girl sings like she means 
it. She tasted operatic vocal training in school, long before she drifted into 
electronic music, and it shows. It's clear she's tasted something much darker 
than that, too. <I>Please don't leave me alone, I'm scared of myself</I>-her 
voice on Horror Inside pleads with us, chills us, and strikes a very secret and 
shared nerve-the spot at the base of our skulls that twinges when the lights go 
out.<BR><BR></FONT></FONT>

    <TD width="40%"><FONT face=arial><FONT size=-1><BR>And what about the man 
      behind the machines? hEADaCHE seems close enough to touch, creating 
      gorgeous, hypnotic, and trance-inducing music. We feel his hands on the 
      synth keys, his fingers turning the knobs. hEADaCHE combines elements of 
      trance, jungle, and trip-hop with the classic sounds of industrial and 
      darkwave, making CEOXiME an indispensable part not only of the Detroit 
      soundscape, but of the growing global sound of electronic music." <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-

      early 1998, hEADaCHE realized CEOXiME didn't have the resources to promote 
      their electronic music in Detroit, but also realized other artists would 
      be in a similar situation. A coalition of artists could help promote each 
      other and help spread success - the <A 
      href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/dec">Detroit Electronica Coaltion</A> 
      was born. hEADaCHE single-handedly gathered 15+ musical groups to pool 
      their resources to produce <A 
      href="http://dec.gemm.com/">D[elEcTROnIc]T</A>. The overwhelming demand 
      from the artists has allowed hEADaCHE to continue the series with <A

      moved to Chicago, allowing CEOXiME to call 2 cities their hometown.
