HEADPHONE COMMUTE:</a><BR>
My afflicted mood guides me towards a promo on my desk that faithfully proclaims: "I AM A STATISTIC". I want to prove it otherwise, and reach in for a spin. An album by an artist limited on words, biography, descriptions. A self-published CD, with a simple insert, and no official press release. Trolling the intarwebs does not reveal much more detail - a basic Discogs entry, a simple Soundcloud, and a five track Bandcamp site - that's all that I could happily collect to cover Ambients in full. Oh, but yes, there's the main artist site that seems to randomly generate characters splattered across the screen: the Russian X and something resembling a O. I could reach out to the artist behind the Secant Prime alias, but I hold back the desire, and harness my suppression and restraint. Instead, I'm left with only music, which happily decides to answer for itself.  <a href="http://reviews.headphonecommute.com/2012/06/30/secant-prime-ambients-self/">read more</a>

WOW - track here is one of the most oppressive, anxiety-inducing dark ambient pieces I've heard in some time.

Sellout records review:</a><BR><BR>

I know, my title doesn't make as much sense as you may have hoped for, but don't worry, when you actually sit down to listen to the new Secant Prime release, you'll get it. "Made" the first track that I heard from the release blew me away, as if I was going through a time warp. This electronic release is a wakeup call, and the first good electronic release of 2015 for me. I heard a TON of records in 2014, but this year has started a bit slow for me. I'm glad that Secant Prime's latest hit my speakers, because it's definitely a top notch release and you'll hear it flowing through insane tracks, layered beats, electrical circuitry, and attention to details that you normally don't get from music of this style. <BR><BR>

I was impressed with how things moved from frenetic to peaceful, to thought provoking. The record has a good balance to it, and there’s no sound wasted here. It doesn't just seek to please your ear as much as it is made to create harmony and chaos into a painting that you'll see upon listening. Close your eyes for a moment and listen to the nuances of tracks like "Electro-Motive", "Dominion", and "Neptune", and you'll see what I'm talking about. The album feels like a nuanced PC game from the 1990s for me, and if you know me, you know how important PC games were to me when I was younger. The digital elements here are pronounced, sonically moving, and tempting to the ears and mind's eyes as you traverse each track individually. <BR><BR>

Don't be fooled thought, Secant Prime knows how to turn melody into upbeat, dance, and electronica that has no definition in words. Take "EMD" for example, and you are taken to a futurism that is definitely up there with the most iconic electronic tracks you've heard. It's mesmerizing how it all works out, and flows amidst the rest of the record, and definitely one of my favorites on this release. <BR><BR>

Secant Prime's "Theta" delivers on all cylinders. There's plenty to hear on this masterpiece. I found myself lost in the transitional tracks, and deeply moved within the nuances of the sounds coming through the speakers. It’s a layered electronic record that is definitely going to move you. Fans of digital, electronic, and music as a whole need to listen to this one, it’s full of passion, life, and a glimpse into the future. <BR><BR>

Sensory Processing Concepts, and this one is for the low registration for sure!<BR><BR>


Secant Prime afflicted mood guides his sound; His Theta EP brings something conceptual that could be used as a soundtrack of a movie. It reminds me of the movie The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, specially the part where they are in the island about to catch the murderer. Industrial and Robust Synths, atmospheres that make you come to a state of self-discovery. Those grainy synths transport you to a different time, a past life, or maybe it's just me.
<BR><BR>

Sometimes you music can transport you, and Secant Prime's direction with this EP just makes it easy to close your eyes and imagine that you are somewhere else. It's been a while since something so rough and industrial has cached my attention.
<BR><BR>

The Must Hear tracks in my Opinion are:<BR>
Neptune Elite<BR>
Dominion<BR>
Tool'n'Die<BR>

<A href="http://jamsphere.com/newreleases/secant-prime-theta-a-whole-new-level-of-ambient-exploration">Jamsphere review:</a><BR>

So much of the electronic music available is really sappy and dull. At first, I was ready to lump this recording in with the slush pile, but closer listening revealed some interesting things going on behind the synth washes. Secant Prime is a musician with original ideas.<BR><BR>

You don't just listen to the latest album "Theta", out 16th of January, you experience it. Deep, vibrating bass lines plumb the depths of your inner core. Atmospherics drifting on the edges of sanity keep your attention throughout. The beats bind everything together; hypnotic, heavy, grooving beats. These are the kind of beats that climb inside your mind and stay a while.<BR><BR>

This album might very well be considered a whole new level of exploration for Secant Prime's on-going journey into the deeper realms of aural discovery.  Secant Prime always strives to develop something special in each and every one of his (or her, as we don't quite know anything about the artist behind the Secant Prime alias) works, but there is indeed a new and unique set of soundscapes to be found here.<BR><BR>

"Theta" is hauntingly addictive. One could begin here and then delve backwards into the catalog of Secant Prime's impetuosity, discovering stranger and stranger music. It would appear Secant Prime was focused on musicality as a primary guiding force, keeping the listener in comfortable and pleasing territory whilst still cranking out the gritty goods. The production is really punchy with strange electronic timbres well positioned into their own place. The chest popping kick tones and snappy snares were designed with plenty of punch-factor.<BR><BR>

This artist is not only prolific but unique, Secant Prime is releasing an album on 1/16/2015 titled "Theta" and we got a preview of it at our studio.  It contains amazingly rich experimental tracks that will set the atmosphere right to anyone who gives it a listen!  Be sure to pick up your copy when it becomes available.  Other works are available on the artists' web site!<BR><BR>

Entire HP Commute review:</a><BR>
It's Saturday morning. It's about 95 degrees outside already. The smog has covered the busy city, and I doubt that I will try to go outside. Instead I’ll turn up the air conditioning, turn down the window blinds, and immerse myself in music. But as I look at my desk still full of shrink wrapped albums I think about time. There are lots of great albums out there, and even more are entering the channels every day, yet there’s just not enough time. Tomorrow is July 1st, which means that we are half way through 2012. Six months of great music has already passed, with six more months to go. I’ve tried keeping up with it all, I’ve tried not caring if I slip, I’ve tried to give each album all of my attention, and in return the music always gives back more. It's an ongoing battle which we all are thankful for. It's a transgression to reproach.<BR>


My afflicted mood guides me towards a promo on my desk that faithfully proclaims: "I AM A STATISTIC". I want to prove it otherwise, and reach in for a spin. An album by an artist limited on words, biography, descriptions. A self-published CD, with a simple insert, and no official press release. Trolling the intarwebs does not reveal much more detail - a basic Discogs entry, a simple Soundcloud, and a five track Bandcamp site - that's all that I could happily collect to cover Ambients in full. Oh, but yes, there's the main artist site that seems to randomly generate characters splattered across the screen: the Russian X and something resembling a O. I could reach out to the artist behind the Secant Prime alias, but I hold back the desire, and harness my suppression and restraint. Instead, I'm left with only music, which happily decides to answer for itself.  <BR><BR>

I feel like following this trend, and leaving not much else behind. Oh, but I’ll give in, and say a few, perhaps exiguous words that cloak some more. They are so common, I should probably abstain, but in my obligatory role I spread the gospel of the few. And they are these: dark ambient patterns are sampled and looped, warped with echoes and never-ending reverb. Occasionally the sound flutters, like a static flash across the screen. The atmospheres are bleak, resembling the murky territories laid down by Future Sound of London, then followed by Demdike Stare, and cleaned up by Black Swan. Ambients is not an album attempting to be vague. By dropping all of the available chitchat, Secant Prime forces the listener to concentrate on music. By barely hiding in the dark the artist lets the sound speak, and not its preconceived portrayal. And by releasing the album on his own, the authors sets his brainchild to roam free. And this it does indeed.<BR><BR>
<a href="http://www.chaindlk.com/reviews/?id=7434">Chain DLK</a><BR>

My intention was to put this record on, and review it; however, it became much more than that. It was quite the scavenger hunt to be honest. The CD, clearly self released, contained not only no record label or catalogue information, but not even a band or project name. Aside from a tracklist that reads like an advanced physics text, there is only a single word: 'Ambients.' The project name comes in the form of a strange, yet intriguing symbol. <BR>

Fast forward through an extensive Google search of song titles and the word 'ambients' and I've discovered that this cd belongs to Secant Prime. A very mysterious project this seems to be. There is an immense lack of information existing about Secant Prime or this CD, but that's ok, I've got a pair of ears, and a very piqued interest at this point; clearly the artist wants the music to stand on its own, uninhibited by preconceived notions and irrelevant labels. <BR>


'Ambients' is a huge record. It may only amount to five tracks, but three of them clock in with double digit lengths. It's a very thick, rich work. Bass heavy drones don't pummel you to the ground, but certainly pin you down tight as they roll not just over, but through you like a thick dystopian syrup. Seemingly unending loops gather and build throughout the record, enveloped in soft static, the echoed memory of forgotten samples and angelic ghosts. There's not a lot more that can be said of this one, it needs just to be listened to, or rather felt, to understand.<BR>
